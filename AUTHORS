Well, I have to definitely give huge thanks to every single one of the
[contributors to Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/master/AUTHORS)
for creating such an *awesome* framework, whose code I have partly ripped to
help develop this :P

A shout out also to:

* Maximilian Schoening (mschoening) for getting me to actually try using Ruby,
  and for introducing me to Sinatra... 'nuff said.
* Charlie Somerville (charliesome), creator of Fructose, which of course Frucnatra
  depends on, and for adding so many features I requested in the first few days of
  Frucnatra's inception. That workflow was crazy productive!
* Kris Jordan (KrisJordan) for that really nice list of HTTP statuses.
